            I poured my heart into this—no AI, no filters, just pure, unedited feelings WKWK. Trust me, every word is 100% lie-proof, so get seateddd.

            I’d be lying if I said having you around is just sunshine and rainbows. You <i>actually</i> made me cry after ages of being tear-free—because you mean <b>that much</b> to me, you dummy. That’s just how much <b>I love you</b>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Thank you for being the most wonderful, sweet, caring, <i>ngeselin</i>, and completely one-of-a-kind person in my life. You've influenced me in so many good ways that I can't help but be endlessly grateful for you.

          Now that you’ve leveled up (with gw tahun ini 😌), I hope every dream, wish, and desire in your heart comes true. And more than anything, I hope we get to celebrate <i>countless</i> more birthdays together—until the end of time.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          So, once again, <b>Happy Birthday, baby 🖤</b> May this year bring you more happiness and wash away every bit of sadness.
